# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

Using Python libraries and logistic regression algorithm for a supervised machine learning 
problem where based on the data given we predict whether it is a mine or a rock. 
Logistic Regression is used as it is a binary classification model.

Here I have also predicted the accuracy of both the training set and test set using accuarcy_score.
